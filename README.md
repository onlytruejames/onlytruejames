### Hello, I'm James

I'm a Computer Science student and occasional musician from Plymouth, UK.

I have two main projects on here. The first is [holographics](https://github.com/onlytruejames/holographics), which is some real-time(ish) graphics software. It's mainly a way to try out graphical processing with a result I can do something with (playing behind live electronic music), although making graphics is too much of a faff for me to actually use it. It's a rewrite of [nuclearGraphics](https://github.com/onlytruejames/nuclearGraphics).
Then there's [parallaxCompiler](https://github.com/onlytruejames/parallaxCompiler) / [parallaxUI](https://github.com/onlytruejames/parallaxUI) which you can make presentations in. The first repo has the actual code which compiles a json document into a html document, the second one is a TERRIBLE editor for it (literally just puts the input and output side by side in a web browser but whatever).

I also made [Assert](https://github.com/AssertApp/Assert) when I was 14 but it wasn't very good and 14 year olds should **not** manage personal data. It was a sign-in service which was a bit like sign-in with Google but it was a bit like a middleman between your website and a few sign-in services which at the time of Assert's demise was Google and Spotify.

Everything else on my profile is almost certainly pointless and/or a joke.
